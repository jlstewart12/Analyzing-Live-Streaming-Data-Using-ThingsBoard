# Analyzing Live Streaming Data Using ThingsBoard

## Mosquitto
* MQTT: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport used to handle sensor data
* MQTT protocol (implemented by
Mosquitto ): Designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging
transport, it is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network
bandwidth is at a premium.
* MQTT Broker is responsible for receiving network connections from the client and handling the clientâ€™s requests of
Subscribe/Unsubscribe and Publish, as well as forwarding the messages published by the client to other subscribers.

5. Values for temperature and humidity will start appearing after running the ```TBPublish.py``` file in VS Code.
    ```
    Temperature: 25 humidity: 95
    Temperature: 81 humidity: 58
    Temperature: 39 humidity: 69
    Temperature: 30 humidity: 54
    Temperature: 50 humidity: 71
    Temperature: 70 humidity: 92
    Temperature: 98 humidity: 54
    ```
6. In a browser window, navigate to http://localhost:8080/. Log in to ThingsBoard using the default tenant administrator account:
    ```
    Login: tenant@thingsboard.org
    Password: tenant
    ```

8.  Create a project in Firebase then add a field in the database titled ```temperature``` and initialize the corresponding field to zero.
9. Create a ```Firebase node```, connect it to a ```Message Type Switch``` node, and add ```Post telemetry``` as the link label.
